It covers a wide range of topics, including Sequelize ORM, creation of models and database management with migrations, Schemas validation with Joi, Error handling Middlewares using Boom, defition of services and routers using Single-Responsability principle, creation of development servers, containers and volumes with Docker, administration of the database with pgAdmin and much more.
